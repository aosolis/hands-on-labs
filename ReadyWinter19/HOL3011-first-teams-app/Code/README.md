# Microsoft Teams Talent Management Sample App in .NET/C#

This app demonstrates connecting to a mock talent management system and allows users and teams to create, manage, and search open positions and candidates. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams. This .NET/C# sample shows simple bot, tab, and messaging extensions, making extensive use of concepts like cards and task modules.
