# 0-60: Get up and running with your very first Microsoft Teams app

## Overview and Introduction
In this lab, you will be getting your first app up and running in Teams. You should do this lab if:
- You have used Microsoft Teams
- You are interested in building apps or solutions for Teams, or Office 365 in general
- You have built Add-ins for Office or SharePoint

We will start with an app that provides basic bot and tab functionality already hosted on Azure. The lab will then include instructions for adding new functionality through the app’s manifest. For those who want to go further, you can add enhancements to the bot and deploy those changes to your own Azure subscription. 

The sample app we're using here manages the hiring process of candidates for open positions in a team – a Talent Management Application. While it looks good, the app doesn't actually do anything – we want to focus on building a Teams app and loading it into Teams, not creating a full-blown talent management application.

## Prerequisites
### Development tools
Please come with the following tools installed on your laptop:
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
    - We recommend signing up for an account. Otherwise your tunnel will time out periodically and you will need to restart ngrok. Each time you restart, the tunnel endpoint changes.
- Visual Studio 2017
    - Install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload
- Microsoft Teams desktop client
- Browser of your choice

### Prepare your Office 365 environment
**IMPORTANT!** You must have an Office 365 tenant to complete this lab. If you don't have one, you can sign up for an Office 365 developer subscription by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program-get-started).

You will first need to enable side loading for Teams within your Office 365 environment. Open the Admin Center by visiting https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/Settings/ServicesAndAddIns from your browser.

Next, select Microsoft Teams. Under the Apps section, scroll down to External Apps and make sure that “Allow sideloading of external apps” is set to On.

# PART 1: Get familiar with Teams apps
In this first part of the Lab you’re going to create a Teams app using an existing base manifest provided as part of this lab. To get you up and running, we will provide a web app that is already running in Azure.

The app package **teams-sample-app-package.zip** is located in this folder. Download it to your PC and unzip the contents to any local folder. It will contain three files:
- manifest.json
- color_icon.png
- outline_icon.png

## Step 1: Create your app using Teams App Studio
The Teams desktop client is pinned to the Task Bar. Click on it and log in with your VM’s credentials. You can play around with Teams and create your own teams and channels.
To create the app package, Teams has a tool called App Studio – and it's actually a Teams app itself. Install it from the Teams app store:

![A screenshot of the Microsoft Teams app store](Images/s2_1.png)

Click on the "Store" icon at the lower left, search for "app studio", click on the "Teams App Studio" entry, "Install" button on the consent dialog, and then the bottom "Open" button on the second next dialog:
![A screenshot of Microsoft Teams App Studio](Images/s2_2.png) 

Click on the "Manifest editor" tab and the "Import and existing app" button:
![A screenshot of the Manifest editor tab in App Studio](Images/s2_3.png)

Load the **teams-sample-app-package.zip** file that you previously unzipped and then click on the "Contoso Talent" entry.

![A screenshot of the Manifest editor with the Contoso Talent Entry](Images/s2_3_5.png)
 
Most of the information has already been filled out for you. The following screenshots show what information to change:

### App Details
![A screenshot of App details in Microsoft Teams](Images/s2_4.png)

### Tabs
A tab is an embedding of an existing web application experience inside of Teams, which users can collaborate around.
You will update the tab information to point to the Azure-hosted tab. In the later section, you can update these entries to point to your local setup.
![A screenshot of editing the Tab information](Images/s2_5.png)

### Bots
This app supports a bot that users can interact with through natural language. It supports a number of commands the return rich cards.
You will update the bot information to point to the Azure-hosted instance. In the later section, you can update these entries to point to your local service (through Ngrok).

![A screenshot of updating the bot definition](Images/s2_6.png)

You can also optionally add a new command. The bot we provide supports signing into AAD and the MS Graph. Under Commands, click “Add” and enter in “login” as the command text, with “connect to Office 365” as the help text. Check both **Personal** and **Team** scopes.

![A screenshot of enabling both Personal and Team scopes](Images/s2_7.png) 

### Messaging extensions
Messaging extensions allow users to search your backend through the Teams UI, similar to how users can query Giphys and emojis. These results are returned as rich cards that can be posted into channels.
![A screenshot of Messaging Extensions](Images/s2_8.png)
 
## Step 3: Run the Sample App
You can load and test your sample app directly from App Studio. To do this, click “Test and distribute” under the Finish section in the Manifest editor. Click “Install” and select the team in which you want to test the app.
 
![A screenshot of installing the app from App studio](Images/s3_1.png)
![A screenshot of the App install diaglog](Images/s3_2.png)
 
Next, you'll see the dialog below (of course, the team name will be different). Here, it shows the General Channel:
![A screenshot of app installation](Images/s3_3.png)

You're now free to experiment with your app:
- Use the "Personal App" version via the "…" menu on the left side of Teams
- Talk to the bot in both 1:1 and channel mode. For example, in 1:1 chat, you can ask it questions like "Top candidates ABCD1234" or "New job posting"
- Use actionable messages to schedule interviews
- Create tabs and add them to channels
- Use the messaging extension to find candidate cards to enrich your conversations

Alternatively, you can also upload your custom app through the Teams UI. To do this, first download your app package locally. It will be saved to your PC’s Downloads folder.

![A screenshot of downloading the app](Images/s3_4.png) 

Next, click on the Store icon in the Teams client and then click "Upload a custom app" at the lower left – the file will be located in your Downloads folder and it's called **teams-sample-app-package.zip** (if you are using the Azure version) or **ContosoTalent.zip** if you built it yourself.
 
# PART 2: Deploying and testing locally
(!TODO: fix the source location)
In Part 2 of the lab, you’ll get a chance to run the app locally, make some minor changes, and then reload the app in Teams. First, you’ll need to grab the source code, which is located in the **microsoft-teams-sample-talent-acquisition** folder with this lab.

Open the solution in Visual Studio by double-clicking on the .sln file. Leave it open for now – we’ll come back to it later.

## Step 4: Create a bot through Bot Framework (Optional)
(!TODO: Change these instructions to use App Studio)
Next, you need to register a bot through the Bot Framework portal. Navigate in your browser to https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new 
Click on the "Sign in" button and log on with your demo tenant or MSA credentials. Agree to the Terms and Conditions if necessary, and you should see a page that looks like what's below. Fill it in according to the instructions.
![A screenshot of registering a new bot](Images/s4_1.png)
 

Once you've logged in to the Application Registration portal (https://apps.dev.microsoft.com), the App name you just created in Bot Framework will appear and an App ID will be generated. Copy this to the clipboard and paste it into Notepad. Then generate a password and copy/paste that to Notepad too. If you forgot to copy the password, simply generate a new one. Remember to click on the "Finish and go back to Bot Framework" button because you're not done yet!
![A screenshot of generating the id and password for the app](Images/s4_2.png)
This will take you back to the previous page. Scroll down to the bottom and click the checkbox and click the Register button. That will take you to a page that looks like this:
 ![A screenshot of the app registration page and clicking on the Microsoft Teams icon](Images/s4_3.png)
Click on the Microsoft Teams icon to add it as a channel (which in this context, has nothing to do with Microsoft Teams channels). Agree to the Terms of Service and you'll see a "Configure MSTeams" – click on Done at the lower left (there's nothing to configure):
 ![A screenshot of configuring Microsoft Teams as a channel for the app](Images/s4_4.png)
After you press the Done button, you'll see Microsoft Teams added to the list of channels. Leave the "Connect to channels" page for your bot open – we're going to come back to it shortly.
## Step 5: Set your App ID and Password and test your bot
Return to Visual Studio and open the Web.config file at the root of the solution. In the TeamsAppId/MicrosoftAppId/MicrosoftAppPassword sections, copy/paste the App ID and Password from Notepad. TeamsAppId doesn't have to be the same as MicrosoftAppId, but it's usually easier if it is, so use the same App ID for both. When you are done, it should look like this:
![A screenshot of Visual Studio showing Web.config from the app project](Images/s5_1.png)
Save the Web.config file and run your solution again.
Now, return to the "Connect to channels" page for your bot, and press the "Test" button at the upper right:
 ![A screenshot of connecting to channels screen and the Test button at the upper right](Images/s5_2.png)
Type "hello" at the lower right and your bot should respond (if a "retry" link appears next to what you typed, click it):
 ![A screenshot of the app running](Images/s5_3.png)
We've verified that your bot is working, so let's try it in Teams.
 
## Step 6: Tunnel localhost to the Internet
Although a Microsoft Teams app is free to access information and APIs inside your firewall, some portions of it, such as the tab URL and bot endpoint, must be accessible from the Internet. The app that you will create today will be running on localhost, so we need a way to make code running on your local machine be accessible from the Internet.
We're using a tool called Ngrok (ngrok.com) for this purpose. 
In the open command prompt (or you can start a new one), type the following command (if ngrok isn't in your PATH, you'll have to prepend its installation directory):

``` ngrok http 3979 -host-header=localhost:3979 ``` 

After a bit, you should see something like this, although the http/https URLs will be different:
![A screenshot of ngrok running](Images/s6_1.png)
Copy the https: URL (not the http: URL) to the clipboard. In the example above, it's https://b26d0449.ngrok.io, but of course yours will be different. **Save the URL; you'll need it shortly.** 
You can minimize the ngrok window; it will keep running in the background.
 

## Step 7: Start your app in Visual Studio
Next, we're going to make a quick check that everything is working properly in Visual Studio. Switch to Visual Studio and click on the Run icon:

![A screenshot of starting the app using the run icon in Visual Studio](Images/s7_1.png)

Visual Studio will build the solution and open http://localhost:3979. But we're interested in what's on the Internet, so paste the URL you saved earlier into a new browser tab. You should see the same page:
 ![A screenshot of the app running in the browser](Images/s7_2.png)
You can stop the app now or leave it running and stop it later.

## Step 8: Update your app package and test
In Part 1 of this lab, you used our Azure instance to test your app. Now, you can use your locally-running Ngrok instance. Return to App Studio within Teams and update these values:
### Tabs
Update the team tab configuration URL and personal tab URL to point to your ngrok instance, e.g. https://b26d0449.ngrok.io/channelconfig.html
 ![A screenshot of the Tabs settings](Images/s8_1.png)

### Bots
Paste in the bot ID that you registered in Step 5. You can also use App Studio to manage your bot’s endpoint by following the instructions in “Setup”.
![A screenshot of the bots settings](Images/s8_2.png)
 
### Messaging extensions
Similar to bots, update the bot ID to be the one you obtained in Step 5.
![A screenshot of the messaging extensions ](Images/s8_3.png)
Now, from App Studio, you can side load the app.

# PART 3: A new messaging extension command

## Step 9: Make some code changes
In this step, you’ll add a new command to the messaging extension to allow searching for candidates in addition to open positions.

In Visual Studio’s solution explorer, under the **Messaging** folder, open **MessagingExtension.cs**
Under the CreateResponse() method, add the following block of code at line 93:
```csharp
else if (query.CommandId == "searchCandidates")
{
  string name = query.Parameters[0].Value.ToString();
  CandidatesDataController controller = new CandidatesDataController();

  foreach (Candidate c in controller.GetTopCandidates("ABCD1234"))
  {
    c.Name = c.Name.Split(' ')[0] + " " + CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ToTitleCase(name);
    var card = CardHelper.CreateSummaryCardForCandidate(c);

    var composeExtensionAttachment = card.ToAttachment().ToComposeExtensionAttachment(CardHelper.CreatePreviewCardForCandidate(c).ToAttachment());
    results.Attachments.Add(composeExtensionAttachment);
  }
}
```
This block of code is what responds to the new command to search for candidates. Rebuild your solution and rerun by hitting F5. In the next step you’ll wire up the command to your app’s manifest.

### Step 10: Add a new command to the manifest
Now you’ll add a new command under the Messaging extensions section of your app in App Studio. Provide the following field values:
- Command Id = searchCandidates
- Title = Candidates
- Description = \<whatever string you want\>
- Parameter
- Name = name
- Title = Name
- Description = \<whatever string you want\>

![A screenshot of adding a new command](Images/s9_1.png)
 
## Test your app
In Visual Studio, hit F5 to restart your local service.

Under Test and distribute, click Install to reload your app.

In Teams, go to any chat or channel conversation. Click on the “…” below the compose box to open the Contoso Talent app – you should now see your new command. Type in any string to initiate the search with your new code changes.

# PART 4: Actionable messages and task modules
In this part we'll add the ability to create new job postings using the bot.

### Step 11: Handle the "new" command
Messages sent to the bot are handled by the `MessageReceivedAsync` method in `RootDialog.cs`. To keep the example relatively simple, the method simply looks for keywords in the text and acts accordingly. A more sophisticated app might use [LUIS](https://luis.ai) to detect intents and entities.

At line 143 add a handler for the "new" keyword:
```csharp
  else if (cmd.Contains("new"))
  {
      await SendCreateNewJobPostingMessage(context);
  }
```
and the corresponding `SendCreateNewJobPostingMessage` method:
```csharp
  private async Task SendCreateNewJobPostingMessage(IDialogContext context)
  {
      IMessageActivity reply = context.MakeMessage();
      reply.Attachments = new List<Attachment>();

      AdaptiveCard card = CardHelper.CreateCardForNewJobPosting();
      Attachment attachment = new Attachment()
      {
          ContentType = AdaptiveCard.ContentType,
          Content = card
      };

      reply.Attachments.Add(attachment);

      await context.PostAsync(reply);
  }
```
The handler constructs a new adaptive card from the contents of `newjobpostingtemplate.json`. The card contains several input fields that define the job posting, and two buttons: "Create posting" and "Cancel". Both buttons are `Action.Submit` actions that post data back to the bot.

Run your project again, and test that your bot recognizes the command that we added by sending it the text "new". It should reply with an adaptive card. (You can try clicking on the buttons, but the bot doesn't know what to do with them yet!)

### Step 12: Handle the "Create posting" button
An [Action.Submit](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.Submit.html) action on an adaptive card takes all the input fields and merges them with the JSON specified in the action's `data` parameter. The result is then sent to the bot in the `value` property of a `message` activity.

In our example, the "Create posting" button is defined as:
```json
  {
    "type": "Action.Submit",
    "title": "Create posting",
    "data": {
      "command": "createPosting"
    }
  }
```
so the bot wil receive a message like:
```json
{
  ...
  "type": "message",
  "value": {
    "command":"createPosting",
    "jobTitle": "Senior PM",
    "jobLevel": "7",
    "jobLocation": "1"
  }
}
```

In the `HandleSubmitAction` of `RootDialog.cs`, at line XXX, add the following block of code:
```csharp
  // Confirmation of job posting message.
  else if (command != null && command.ToString() == "createPosting")
  {
      var pos = new OpenPositionsDataController().CreatePosition(
        parameters["jobTitle"].ToString(),
        int.Parse(parameters["jobLevel"].ToString()),
        Constants.Locations[int.Parse(parameters["jobLocation"].ToString())], activity.From.Name);

      await SendNewPostingConfirmationMessage(context, pos);
  }
```
